# Water Feature Controller Project Entry for Hackster Connect Things with Code Contest

This is a repository for the Water Feature Project.  The project is built using the Modus Toolbox Eclipse IDE and was created from the WiFi-MQTT-Client example application.

This project controls the pump and light for an outdoor water fountain using a Tuya compatible dual WiFi Smart Plug.  The pump and light will turn on when there is presence detected on the adjacent patio. Presence detection is done using a Doppler radar shield.  The MQTT client RTOS task establishes a connection with the configured MQTT server, and creates two tasks: publisher and subscriber. The publisher task publishes messages on a topic when presence is detected.  A Node-Red program passes MQTT messages from the server to control the Tuya Smart plug. In case of unexpected disconnection of MQTT or Wi-Fi connection, the application executes a reconnection mechanism to restore the connection.  The project also includes a local TFT display to monitor radar detection states and ambient light.


**Sequence of operation**

1. WiFi is connected to access point.
2. MQTT client is connected to MQTT server running on RPi4 on local network.
3. MQTT client sets up publish and subscribe on topic "presencedetected".
4. The GPIO interrupt service routine (ISR) notifies the publisher task when "target detected" signal is received from radar shield.
5. The publisher task publishes message on "presencedetected" topic to indicate state of "target detected" signal (true/false).
6. The MQTT server sends back the message to the MQTT client because it is also subscribed to the same topic.
7. A Node-Red program (also running on the RPi4) is subscribed to the topic and forwards the MQTT messages to the Tuya Smart plug.

### Configuring the MQTT client

#### Wi-Fi and MQTT configuration macros

 Macro                               |  Description
 :---------------------------------- | :------------------------
 **Wi-Fi Connection Configurations**  |  In *configs/wifi_config.h*
 `WIFI_SSID`       | SSID of the Wi-Fi AP to which the MQTT client connects
 `WIFI_PASSWORD`   | Passkey/password for the Wi-Fi SSID specified above
 `WIFI_SECURITY`   | Security type of the Wi-Fi AP. See `cy_wcm_security_t` structure in *cy_wcm.h* file for details.
 `MAX_WIFI_CONN_RETRIES`   | Maximum number of retries for Wi-Fi connection
 `WIFI_CONN_RETRY_INTERVAL_MS`   | Time interval in milliseconds in between successive Wi-Fi connection retries
 **MQTT Connection Configurations**  |  In *configs/mqtt_client_config.h*
 `MQTT_BROKER_ADDRESS`      | Hostname of the MQTT broker
 `MQTT_PORT`                | Port number to be used for the MQTT connection. As specified by IANA, port numbers assigned for MQTT protocol are *1883* for non-secure connections and *8883* for secure connections. However, MQTT brokers may use other ports. Configure this macro as specified by the MQTT broker.
 `MQTT_SECURE_CONNECTION`   | Set this macro to `1` if a secure (TLS) connection to the MQTT broker is required to be established; else `0`.
 `MQTT_USERNAME` <br> `MQTT_PASSWORD`   | User name and password for client authentication and authorization, if required by the MQTT broker. However, note that this information is generally not encrypted and the password is sent in plain text. Therefore, this is not a recommended method of client authentication.
 **MQTT Client Certificate Configurations**  |  In *configs/mqtt_client_config.h*
 `CLIENT_CERTIFICATE` <br> `CLIENT_PRIVATE_KEY`  | Certificate and private key of the MQTT client used for client authentication. Note that these macros are applicable only when `MQTT_SECURE_CONNECTION` is set to `1`.
 `ROOT_CA_CERTIFICATE`      |  Root CA certificate of the MQTT broker
 **MQTT Message Configurations**    |  In *configs/mqtt_client_config.h*
 `MQTT_PUB_TOPIC`           | MQTT topic to which the messages are published by the Publisher task to the MQTT broker
 `MQTT_SUB_TOPIC`           | MQTT topic to which the subscriber task subscribes to. The MQTT broker sends the messages to the subscriber that are published in this topic (or equivalent topic).
 `MQTT_MESSAGES_QOS`        | The Quality of Service (QoS) level to be used by the publisher and subscriber. Valid choices are `0`, `1`, and `2`.
 `ENABLE_LWT_MESSAGE`       | Set this macro to `1` if you want to use the 'Last Will and Testament (LWT)' option; else `0`. LWT is an MQTT message that will be published by the MQTT broker on the specified topic if the MQTT connection is unexpectedly closed. This configuration is sent to the MQTT broker during MQTT connect operation; the MQTT broker will publish the Will message on the Will topic when it recognizes an unexpected disconnection from the client.
 `MQTT_WILL_TOPIC_NAME` <br> `MQTT_WILL_MESSAGE`   | The MQTT topic and message for the LWT option described above. These configurations are applicable only when `ENABLE_LWT_MESSAGE` is set to `1`.
 `MQTT_DEVICE_ON_MESSAGE` <br> `MQTT_DEVICE_OFF_MESSAGE`  | The MQTT messages that control the device (LED) state in this code example.
 **Other MQTT Client Configurations**    |  In *configs/mqtt_client_config.h*
 `GENERATE_UNIQUE_CLIENT_ID`   | Every active MQTT connection must have a unique client identifier. If this macro is set to `1`, the device will generate a unique client identifier by appending a timestamp to the string specified by the `MQTT_CLIENT_IDENTIFIER` macro. This feature is useful if you are using the same code on multiple kits simultaneously.
 `MQTT_CLIENT_IDENTIFIER`     | The client identifier (client ID) string to be used during MQTT connection. If `GENERATE_UNIQUE_CLIENT_ID` is set to `1`, a timestamp is appended to this macro value and used as the client ID; else, the value specified for this macro is directly used as the client ID.
 `MQTT_CLIENT_IDENTIFIER_MAX_LEN`   | The longest client identifier that an MQTT server must accept (as defined by the MQTT 3.1.1 spec) is 23 characters. However, some MQTT brokers support longer client IDs. Configure this macro as per the MQTT broker specification.
 `MQTT_TIMEOUT_MS`            | Timeout in milliseconds for MQTT operations in this example
 `MQTT_KEEP_ALIVE_SECONDS`    | The keepalive interval in seconds used for MQTT ping request
 `MQTT_ALPN_PROTOCOL_NAME`   | The application layer protocol negotiation (ALPN) protocol name to be used that is supported by the MQTT broker in use. Note that this is an optional macro for most of the use cases. <br>Per IANA, the port numbers assigned for MQTT protocol are 1883 for non-secure connections and 8883 for secure connections. In some cases, there is a need to use other ports for MQTT like port 443 (which is reserved for HTTPS). ALPN is an extension to TLS that allows many protocols to be used over a secure connection.
 `MQTT_SNI_HOSTNAME`   | The server name indication (SNI) host name to be used during the transport layer security (TLS) connection as specified by the MQTT broker. <br>SNI is extension to the TLS protocol. As required by some MQTT brokers, SNI typically includes the hostname in the "Client Hello" message sent during TLS handshake.
 `MQTT_NETWORK_BUFFER_SIZE`   | A network buffer is allocated for sending and receiving MQTT packets over the network. Specify the size of this buffer using this macro. Note that the minimum buffer size is defined by the `CY_MQTT_MIN_NETWORK_BUFFER_SIZE` macro in the MQTT library.
 `MAX_MQTT_CONN_RETRIES`   | Maximum number of retries for MQTT connection
 `MQTT_CONN_RETRY_INTERVAL_MS`   | Time interval in milliseconds in between successive MQTT connection retries
